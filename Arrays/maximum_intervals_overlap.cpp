/*
Consider a big party where N guests came to it and a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times was 
maintained. Find the minimum time at which there were maximum guests at the party. Note that entries in 
the register are not in any order.

Example 1:
Input:  N = 5
		Entry= {1, 2,10, 5, 5}
		Exit = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
Output: 3 5
Explanation: At time 5 there were 
             guest number 2, 4 and 5 present.
