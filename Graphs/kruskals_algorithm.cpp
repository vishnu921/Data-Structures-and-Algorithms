/*
Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm builds the spanning tree by adding edges one by one into a growing spanning tree. 
Kruskal's algorithm follows greedy approach as in each iteration it finds an edge which has least 
weight and add it to the growing spanning tree.

Algorithm Steps:

    Sort the graph edges with respect to their weights.
    Start adding edges to the MST from the edge with the smallest weight until the edge of the largest weight.
    Only add edges which doesn't form a cycle , edges which connect only disconnected components.
