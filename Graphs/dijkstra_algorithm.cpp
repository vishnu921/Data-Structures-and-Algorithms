/*
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:

This algorithm is used to find the shortest distance between any two vertices in a weighted non-cyclic graph.
Here, we will be using a slight modification of the algorithm according to which we will be figuring o
ut the minimum distance of all the vertices from the particular source vertex.
